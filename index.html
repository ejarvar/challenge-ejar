<h2>Merging the datasets</h2>
<p>
    We have two datasets containing information from the Data & Analytics department webpage.
    The first dataset is a JSON file containing text and some attributes of each blog in a list.
    The second dataset is a CSV containing the google analytics information from each URL related to
    the webpage.

    These two files need to be preprocessed in a way were both datasets follow the same structure.
    The steps we will follow are:
    <ol>
        <li>Define which tool can provide us with data manipulation operations, machine learning
            and data analysis features according to the amount of data we have.
        </li>   
        <li>Define a key attribute that both datasets can use for merging</li>
        <li>Define the datatype of each feature on both datasets</li>
        <li>Preprocessing and Mergin the data?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1. Since we are not manipulating big amounts of data, the tool we will use for manipulating the data is Pandas</h3>
    <p>This library offers us all the features we are looking for for this task by working with 
        DataFrame objects.</p>
        <h3>2. Key attributes</h3>
    <p>The key attribute we will use is the URL in the JSON file and PAGE in the CSV file.
        Since both keys do not have an exact match, we also need to preprocess both attributes as strings
        where we look for a string match from one inside the other. This way of matching the keys, also
        help us by removing all the URLs that are not giving us any information for future analysis.
    </p>
    <h3>Defining the datatypes of of each attribute</h3>
    <p>Since no information from the datatype of any attribute was provided, to define properly the datatypes, we need to do an
        exploratory analysis first; doing it in advance might not be totally accurate and could need some extra changes later.
        Therefore, we will read each feature as strings first.
    </p>
    <h3>Merging the data?</h3>
    <p>The content of each blog also contained some noise related to the html
        structure, to remove this, some regular expressions were needed to apply in order
        to delete it.
        In this case, both datasets do not need to be merged in advance. Since both datasets now
        have a common structure, we should just read them and use pandas operations such as merge and group by
        when needed while doing our studies.

<h2>Identifying trending topics</h2>
<p>
    To identify the trending topics in our blogs, we will use a topic modelling
    algorithm.
    We want to have some representation of each document in a matrix to feed any algorithm.
    We will do this by defining a matrix that can represent how important is a word to a document
    in a collection of documents according to its frequency.

    First, we started with some data preprocessing techniques.
    <ol>
        <li>Tokenization using Spacy tokenization rules for Spanish</li>
        <li>Removing stopwords. Spacy's list of Spanish stopwords</li>
        <li>Lowercasing</li>
        <li>For the words representation, we did not use any embedding lemmatization or
            stemming process.
            The stemming approach, since it is a heuristic approach, it could
            return nonsensical stems.
            For the lemmatization, our alternative is to use a pretrained model
            like the one provided from spacy but the training takes longer times
            and it is not necessary for this task.
            (Only one line of code has to be modified)
        </li>
    </ol>

    We trained a model where we only use the top 500 words and we want to see only
    the top 10 topics.
</p>

</pre>

<h3>Which topics are we missing?</h3>
<p>
        For this part we will use a pretrained word embedding in order to return the most similar topics to our topics.
        Since some of them are available online, we will not implement it as our part of our code.
        In this case we used sense2vec which demo is available here: https://explosion.ai/demos/sense2vec
        In this wordembedding we can query any doc and it will calculate the most similar topics.
        When we query, for instance, 'data analytics', the most similar topics are:

        <table>
                <tr>
                    <th><b>Topic</b></th>

<h2>Recommender engine</h2>
<p>
    A recommender system can be anything, we could implement a system that
    randomly returns any article as a suggestion to the reader, we can think of
    learning from the user and suggest them articles related to their taste.
    We can also analyse the article that was read by the user and recommend a similar
    one.
    Defining which method to follow, relies on the data we have.
    In our case, do not have information from each user but we do have
    information from each document. Therefore, we will use the last option that
    creates a representation of each article by using a similar approach we 
    used in our trending topic system.
    With this vectorized representation we will recommend the user an article that
    has a similar representation to the one who is currently reading.

<h2>Most successful post</h2>
<p>Studying the most successful post requires an exploratory analysis of the scraping dataset.
    In addition, while doing this exploratory analysis, we can also understand more our data, therefore, 
    we will be able to give our dataset a better structure by defining each feature datatype and have better feature naming.</p>
<p>For this part we used two approaches, we used graphical methods for identifying the most successful post 
    and we also use an statistical analysis.
    Our studies showed:
    From our graphical method and our statistical method (excluding bounce rate), 
    we found that the most successful post is: 
    Los Mejores M√°steres de Ciencia de Datos para Considerar este Verano - BBVA Data & Analytics 
    This is due to the high number of page views, user views and unique page views. As we saw at the scatter plot, 
    this article is an evident outlier. 
    On the other hand, when we include the bounce rate to our statiscal method. 
    The most successful post is:
    Transforming a Bank into a Data-Driven Business - BBVA Data & Analytics 
    This post has a low bounce rate, which value is way better than our other result. 
    The conclusion we can obtain from both results is that it depends on how we want to define a successful post, 
    for example, when an article has a low bounce rate, it could mean that people that finds the article more attractive,
    therefore, they tend to stay and read it all and made the user check similar posts and for us this could mean that the posts is successful.
    Or on the other hand, if we are focusing on how this article was able to attract more people, maybe due to a marketing strategy,
    where showing the brand and this topic was reason of the publication, then the post with higher visits is the most successful one.

<h2>The Bounce Rate</h2>
<p>
    Sources: 
    <a href="https://www.optimizesmart.com/two-powerful-ways-to-reduce-bounce-rate/" target="Bounce rate">Bounce Rate</a>
    <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009409?hl=en" target="Google analytics">Google Analytics</a>
</p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>First: In order to introduce successfull measures against a high bounce rate, the term bounce rate must be determined precisely. 
            As the proposed source is stating, a bounce equals to "a single-page session" on the corresponding site/landing page. 
            More in detail: "a session that triggers only a <b>single request to the Analytics server</b>, 
            such as when a <b>user opens a single page</b> on your site and then <b>exits without triggering any other requests to the Analytics server</b>
            during that session" (see provided link https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009409?hl=en). 
            Consequently, the bounce rate results as number of single-page sessions divided by all sessions within a certain time period.
        </li>
        <li>Second: This technical explanation can be expanded by a qualitative perspective on the content of the landing page itself: 
            the content did not seem to have engaged the user up to the amount to exploring other websites connected to and therefore 
            beyond this particular landing page.
        </li>
        <li>Third: As the source also is stating, the effect of a high bounce rate highly depends on the character of the underlying landing page. 
            A main page, which clearly works as a connection between other related sites, should engange the user to visit more pages, 
            and should have a low bounce rate. On the other hand, a blog post being perfectly able to exist alone without 
            the need of any other blog posts can have a higher bounce rate without raising any suspicions. 
            Of course it is wished that the user continues reading other blog posts, 
            but maybe the user came for a particular reason from a particular source and returns to that source after finishing to read. 
            Since we are only focussing the analysis on blog posts, the higher bounce rate might be much less of a problem in general, 
            even though some suggestions for lowering it are still provided. 
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Following these three definitions and perspectives, there are several ways to technically lower the bounce rate of a website:
    <ul>
        <li> 1) & 3): When the bounce rate only includes single requests, lowering the bounce rate naturally results from increasing the number of
            requests the user is making. This technical increasing is done for instance by defining particular events the user is triggering 
            which are tracked via specific event tracking code (on the website). Since at least two request to the server will be noted, 
            the session will automatically not be counted as single request bounce. Potential events might be: the user enters the landing 
            page and needs to press a play button in order to play the video he/she was intended to watch. By pressing the play button which 
            is wired with the tracking code, the second request is sent to the analytics server. This can also be done automatically, 
            without requiring the user to actually press the play button. As soon as the user enters the webpage, the video plays. 
            The only thing to be made sure is that the play button is tracked by event tracking code. Alternatively, 
            the user also can trigger a social event such as sharing the article he/she just read. The sharing would be tracked by tracking code, 
            causing the second request to be sent to the analytics server. 
            When following this strategy, is has to be kept in mind that the user still only visits that single website without 
            browsing further sites. Only the way of counting is adjusted to lead to a lower bounce rate. However, 
            in case of blog posts, which result in single requests due to their purpose (to inform the user about a certain topic 
            aka the user creates a conversion by simply staying at this single page and reading it), 
            an adjustment of bounce rate is strongly recommended to avoid misleading statistics such as a 100% very high bounce rate, 
            even though the task of the website was fullfilled and the user converted. 
        </li>
        
        <li> 
            2) From the point of view of the website's contents, the user was not engaged enough to browse other, maybe related websites. 
            Therefore, is has to be guaranteed that the content of the landing page satisfy the user's query 
            (e.g. when talking about text mining, no article about decision trees should represent the landing page instead). 
            The more the website satisfies the query, the more unlikely the user will bounce. 
            Closely related to query relevant content also the source of the visit must be taken into account: 
            keywords or marketing channels which target a high number of users but the quality of those users is low, 
            should be avoided. This "poor" traffic will more likely bounce and not convert, therefore these visitors are not relevant 
            for the product anyway. 
            Additionally, also the so-called call to action must be clearly visible. In case of a blog post, 
            the user must be successfully guided through the story by using headings, sub-headings, images or other directional clues. 
            In case of blog posts, related blogs might be highlighted at the end of the original blog post 
            (topic related, recommendation by other readers etc.). 
            This keeps the user browsing the website, giving him/her a need to explore more topics. 
        </li>
        <li> 
            And last but not least, the content must be presented in an appealing way to the user, so e.g. nice font, 
            images, clear navigation, using responsive design, enough white space between font/paragraphs, headings etc. 
            The website contents also must load in reasonable time. However, for a sample of blogs from your website, 
            this criteria seem to be fullfilled already, which leaves no recommendation open for this topic. 
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Additional data suggestions</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For getting more information about the engagement of the user on the website, events should be defined and tracked by code 
            (e.g. playing a video, sharing the article, filling in a form etc.) and those statistics also returned for analysis
        </li>
        <li>
            Better relations between blog posts and therefore higher engagement of the user is expected, when the blog posts are tagged 
            by keywords (e.g. topic related) and also show e.g. Top 3 articles being very similar to the just read post. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Add topic/keyword cloud at the side of the text to give user information, what other topics he/she can research on the website.
        </li>
        <li>
            More about the content of the post itself, whether a video/images are embedded, if yes, how many. 
            Whether headings and sub-headings are used and the number of headings in the article. Whether links are embedded (and how many), 
            even distinguishing between links leading to another internal page (other blog posts) or external websites. 
        </li>
        <li>        
            More information about the source: whether this source was an ad (paid) or unpaid (e.g. the blog post was mentioned in another article)
            and when it was an add, the impressions and clicks of the ad in order to determine whether the actual number of users is good.
        </li>
        <li>
            More information about the device on which the blog post was read: e.g. the operating system of the device 
            (for tablet and mobile) or the browser for desktop (firefox vs. chrome etc.), 
            this helps finding clusters of especially engaged readers, improving the quality of ads (e.g. targeting only those readers) 
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding information about errors: e.g. when the blog post website was not loading or network connections failed. 
            Google Analytics provides a list of errors which can be defined to be tracked and used for further analysis.
        </li>
